# webScrapeProductData
Scrape data from websites and put it in a consistent format

Entry Points:
- BD_webScrape.js
- Mammut_webScrape.js

These generate json files of product data pulled from their respective sites.
This will eventually form the basis for my passion project to display climbing gear in a tabular format for comparison and to find the cheapest price available.
