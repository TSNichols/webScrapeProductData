    "description": "Developed in collaboration with BD Athlete Adam Ondra, the airNET is a cutting-edge harness that features our patented airNET Technology-an ultra-breathable fabric for high-end performance sport climbing that distributes loads evenly across the \"net\" during falls. The airNET also includes a patented Infinity Loop for belaying, which is durable, low profile, and eliminates the dreaded belay-loop-shift when dogging a route and the belay loop seam catches. At a svelte 235 grams (men's medium) we've included two pressure molded gear loops in the front while keeping the rear gear loops low-profile webbing-a request from Ondra who had cut the back gear loops from his competition harnesses to save weight and reduce bulk. Black Dynex lower and upper tie-in points are durable and light, and the seamless, taped edges of the waistbelt and leg-loops proved next-to-skin comfort during intense redpoints.",

    "description": "Engineered for sending in all styles of climbing, from gym laps to winter ice, the Black Diamond Momentum 3S brings back the classic 3-buckle design but with a modern touch, thanks to the pre-threaded Speed buckles on the leg-loops and waistbelt. Allowing you to save time and eliminate error when donning your harness, these buckles provide maximum fit-adjustability while our Dual Core Construction™ provides an ultra-comfortable waistbelt that soaks up long hanging belays and whippers with ease. Four pressure-molded gear loops hold the rack, while the rip-stop fabric of the leg-loops add durability to ensure you’ll be roping up season after season.",
